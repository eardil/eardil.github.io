### The Blog
This site was created as a way to log my first steps into the Python language for simulation, visualization and machine learning. Also, I reserve the right to write about random stuff that I find interesting or relevant.

For the design, I used [Hyde Theme](http://mdo.github.io/hyde) based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

## The guy

I'm an applied mathematician and data analyst from *México*. I'm interested in data analysis, simulation, probability, combinatorics and linear optimization. 

I'm currently living in *Cancún* and working for a travel & leisure company. For more information on previous experience you can refer to my [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isimonin).
