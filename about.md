### ...the guy
![Image](../public/port.jpg?raw=true)
I'm an applied mathematician and data analyst from *México*. I'm interested in data analysis, probability, combinatorics and linear optimization. 

I currently live in *Cancún*, where I work for a travel & leisure company. For more information on previous experience you can refer to my [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isimonin).

### ...the blog
This site was created as a way to log my first steps into the Python language for simulation, visualization and machine learning. Also, I'm using this as an excuse to introduce myself to version control and Git by hosting it on Github Pages.

Of course, I reserve the right to write about random stuff that I find interesting or relevant.

For the design, I used [Hyde Theme](http://mdo.github.io/hyde) based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

### ...the content
All the code written for this blog is for educational and recreational purposes. I have created a [Blog_Code](https://github.com/eardil/Blog_Code) repository on my [Github page](https://github.com/eardil) where I publish the Jupyter notebooks of the blog posts so you can fork them and play with them. If you see the notebook for a future blog post and have some feedback feel free to make a pull request.
