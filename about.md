### The Blog
This site was created as a way to log my first steps into the Python language for simulation, visualization and machine learning. Also, I reserve the right to write about random stuff that I find interesting or relevant.

[Hyde](http://mdo.github.io/hyde) is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme, designed and built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It's an elegant, open source, and mobile first theme for quickly getting a static site up and running.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Fonts PT Sans (headings) and PT Serif (body), and are served by [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.org), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
